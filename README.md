## Goal

Create a separate website that uses an API call to your Wordpress API to populate a products page.

## Brief

Using the WordPress REST API, create a separate website (not build as a page on WordPress) that lists the products you created with WooCommerce on your WordPress site.

Because you're using the API, each time an administrator creates or updates a product, the change will pull through to your product list page.

- Your products page should be a standalone site (written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and
- include a list of all the:
  - product names,
  - images and
  - prices.
  - Each product should have a call-to-action button to 'View More'.
